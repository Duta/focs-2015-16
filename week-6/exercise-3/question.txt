(3pts) A company stock is said to be in a slump from the time t it started to descend until the time t+k just before it became greater than or equal to the price it had at time t. The historical stock price of OCaml Industries is recorded in a list of integers which stores the stock price at regular intervals. You need to write a function that given a historical list of prices will return the longest slump and the time when it started. In case there are several slumps of equal length the function returns the earliest one.

slump : int list -> int * int

For example

slump [1;2;3;2;3;4] = (1, 2)
slump [1;2;3;4;3;1;2;2;1;3;4;5;6;2] = (6,3)
slump [1;2;3] = (0,0)
slump [] = (0,0)
