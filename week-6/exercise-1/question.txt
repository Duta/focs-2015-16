(4pts) Implement the function dif which computes the symmetric difference of two lists, which means collecting all the elements that appear in only one of the lists. The order of the remaining elements should be unchanged, with the elements of the first list occurring before the elements of the second list. 

dif : 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list

Example:

dif [1;2;3;2;3] [3;4;3] = [1; 2; 2; 4]
