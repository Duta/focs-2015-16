A priority queue is a queue in which each element has an associated integer value called "the priority". When a new element is added to the queue it must be inserted before all elements with strictly lower priority and after all elements with priority greater or equal. 

Implement a (possibly naive) priority queue which has the following enqueue and dequeue function:

val enq : 'a * int -> ('a * int) list -> ('a * int) list = <fun>

val deq : ('a * int) list -> 'a * ('a * int) list = <fun>

For example, 

let q = enq (a, 1) q 
let q = enq (b, 3) q 
let q = enq (c, 1) q 
let x, q = deq q      (* x should be equal to b *)
let x, q = deq q      (* x should be equal to a *)
let x, q = deq q      (* x should be equal to c *)
