(3pts) Write a "zip" function which takes as arguments two lists and combines them in alternating fashion starting with the first one. If one of the two lists is longer then the extra elements are simply appended. 

The signature of the function is val zip : 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list

Some examples:

# zip [1;2;3;4] [5;6;7;8] ;;
- : int list = [1; 5; 2; 6; 3; 7; 4; 8]
# zip [1] [2;3;4;5];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
# zip [1;2;3;4] [5;6];;
- : int list = [1; 5; 2; 6; 3; 4]
