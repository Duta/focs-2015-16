(harder) Write an OCaml function with signature

is_bij : (bool -> bool) -> bool

which tests whether its argument is a bijective function, which means it returns true if the argument is bijective and false otherwise.

Hint: A function is said to be bijective if it produces a different output for every input and every possible output value can be produced using some input.
